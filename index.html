            <p>A few words you might not have seen before. The /usr/bin/chef command is a new command line tool that comes with ChefDK, kind of like knife but handles higher-level operations including working with policies. Policyfile, or Policyfile.rb, is a Ruby code file containing the description of a policy. Each node is attached to a single policy name and a single policy group, the policy name is like the role of the node and the group is like its environment. A compiled policy, or Policyfile.lock, is a snapshot of a completely resolved policy like Gemfile.lock or Berksfile.lock.</p>

            <p>The two main commands to get started with policies are “chef install” and “chef push”. install works like “berks install”, compiling the policy to a single snapshot and downloading all needed cookbooks to ~/.chefdk. push replaces commands like “berks upload” and “knife cookbook upload” to send the compiled policy and all the cookbooks it is using up to the Chef Server.</p>

            <p>The three main directives: <code>name</code>, <code>default_source</code>, and <code>run_list</code>. The name, as you might imagine, sets the name of the policy. The <code>default_source</code> directive adds to the list of default sources used to find cookbooks without an explicit source. The <code>run_list</code> directive sets the primary run list for the policy, or put more directly, what nodes assigned to this policy will execute.</p>

            <p><code>run_list</code> accepts either multiple arguments or an array of recipe names. You can use the <code>recipe[name]</code> syntax but you cannot use roles in a policy’s run list so this is generally redundant.</p>

            <p>In addition to setting the primary run list, we can also set addition named run lists via <code>named_run_list</code>. These take the place of traditional override run lists (<code>chef-client -o</code>) while still allowing the policy to know about the potential override so that its cookbooks are included in the compiled snapshot.</p>

            <p>That covers the basic syntax and data for what goes in a Policyfile, now let’s look at the main commands. As mentioned before, the first command you’ll usually encounter is <code>chef install</code>. It takes an optional path to the file to process, but otherwise uses <code>./Policyfile.rb</code>. If the <code>Policyfile.lock</code> file doesn’t exist, this command will run a version solver to generate a set of cookbooks that matches requirements from the policy and the various <code>depends</code> values in the cookbooks being used. This compiled policy snapshot is then written to disk for next time, and all the cookbooks used in it are downloaded to the local cache in a manner similar to Berkshelf or Bundler.</p>

          </td>
          <td class="notes">
            <p><code>chef update</code> is currently just a slight modification to the install command in that it forces a policy recompile even if there is an existing lockfile. At some point in the future support will be added for more fine-grained updates, but for now just use it when you want to re-solve a policy to pick up new or changed cookbooks.</p>

        <tr class="slide">

          </td>
          <td class="notes">
            <p>And finally we have <code>chef push</code>, which acts like <code>berks upload</code> in that it reads in a solved policy (lockfile) and uploads it to a Chef Server. Unlike <code>berks upload</code> this isn’t a global operation, we push a compiled policy to a specific policy group. Policy groups aren’t really first class objects per se, more just a kind of tag that creates segments within a single policy. Usually this is used to implement a separation between staging and production, or whatever other organizational segments you might have. The push command will also make sure any cookbooks needed for the policy get uploaded along with it.</p>

          </td>
          <td class="notes">
            <p>By default all policy commands will look for a file named “Policyfile.rb” in the current directory. This makes sense for policies driven by a top-level role cookbook, but in a flatter, central-repository-driven we will usually want a folder with each policy as its own file. Each command will accept an optional argument to specify a path to the policy source. In a repo-centric structure we would generally put these under policies/ to match cookbooks/ and roles/.</p>

          <td class="notes">
            <p>To pull everything together, a simple example of working with a policy. First we create the policy code and compile it (we’ll just assume we got it right on the first try). Then we deploy the the policy out to stage 1, do something to verify that we are happy with the stage, and then roll it out to stage 2. Later on we have edited some cookbooks and want to pushed them out so we run chef update to recompile the policy, and then use chef push to update each group in sequence like before.</p>

            <p>A place this single pipeline issue comes into sharp focus is when dealing with a node that runs cookbooks managed by multiple teams.

            <p>The next major stumbling block is usually around environment-level attributes.

            <p>The simplest is to use the group name as a top-level key in the attribute name for things you know will vary by group. You can access the name of the current node’s policy group via <code>node.policy_group</code>. This is only workable in situations where you control how the attribute data is used though.</p>

            <p>For situations where you need to use cookbooks not explicitly designed for this, you can use a hoisting pattern to copy the attribute data out of the group-specific subtree and overlay it on the rest of the attributes. This is often the most robust solution, but the code to implement can be tricky. A simple version is shown here, but stay tuned for a reusable cookbook that implements a more robust version.</p>

            <p>A quick version of a traditional Chef cookbook release process. First we updated the cookbook version in metadata.rb, and make sure to follow SemVer. Then we make a git tag, maybe use Stove to push to a Supermarket site, and <code>berks upload</code> to push it to a Chef Server. Then we edit the Chef environment for each stage to roll the new version out, making sure chef-client completes successfully on each stage. Importantly this process is cookbook-centric, so we release each cookbook independently.</p>

            <p>Usually a release process like this is coupled with SemVer so that we can use that semantic information to structure how new releases flow out to different environments and users. It allows using the pessimistic range operator in environments and dependencies, leaving the version solver in Chef Server and Berkshelf to work out the details. Plus the internet told me SemVer is awesome so clearly I want it!</p>

            <p>But it isn’t all positive. Tracking which changes are compatible with which other changes presents some cognitive load during development. Additionally when running a release process you often need to release multiple cookbooks in the right order. On top of that, Chef’s version solver is very limited and only supports three component <code>x.y.z</code> version numbers, no extra tags like <code>-pre</code> or <code>-rc1</code>. This makes it difficult to handle releases when different environments are targeting different git branches of the same cookbook.</p>

            <p>So we want a lighter weight solution. Enter YoloVer: a workflow based around snapshots of a whole run list instead of multiple discrete projects with their own release processes. As you might imagine, this workflow is based around policies and Policyfiles. Using all the tools we just learned, we can manage cookbook deployments with a granularity of whole-repository snapshots. This means we don’t need the overhead of a per-cookbook release system but still retain control over rollouts.</p>

The <code>converge</code> command creates a new virtual machine using Vagrant (or one of the other drivers if set that up), installs Chef, and runs the requested policy. <code>kitchen converge</code> on its own will converge all instances (suite plus platform pairs) but it can take an optional regular expression to filter down to specific instances. When we are done working, use <code>kitchen destroy</code> to clean up all the virtual machines.</p>
